If you have integrity, nothing else matters. If you don't have integrity, nothing else matters.
Alan K. Simpson

If you torture statistics long enough, they'll eventually confess the truth
Alan K. Simpson

A society like ours, which professes no one religion and has allowed all religions to decay, which indulges freedom to the point of license and individualism to the point of anarchy, needs all the support that responsible, cultivated homes can furnish. I hope your generation will provide a firmer shelter for civilized standards.
Alan K. Simpson
